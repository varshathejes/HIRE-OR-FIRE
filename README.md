# HIRE-OR-FIRE
This project is a machine learning classification problem. The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition in the current scenario based on different features. It was the classification problem. 

#Steps to predict the rate of employee attrition
1)Import Libraries and read data set
2)Describe the dataset
3)Data Transforamtion / Categorical to Numerical
4)Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
5)Split the dataset into train and test set
6)Machine Learning Modeling
7)train the model (Fit)
8)Test the trained model (prediction )
9)Model Evaluation
